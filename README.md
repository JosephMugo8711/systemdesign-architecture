## SetUp Instruction
### Requirements
* Optional: Diagramming tools like **Lucidchart**, **Draw.io**, or **Excalidraw** for documenting architecture  
* Text editor eg [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)


### Getting Started


1. Clone the repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JosephMugo8711/systemdesign-architecture
    ```

    ```bash
    cd systemdesign-architecture
    ```

2. Install dependencies
After cloning the repository, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```





## Technologies Used
