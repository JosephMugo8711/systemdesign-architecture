## Project Description
This project is dedicated to understanding, implementing, and documenting system design and architecture concepts. 
It serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing real-world system design challenges.
The focus is on using Node.js, Java, and TypeScript to develop scalable and efficient systems while documenting 
fundamental concepts, trade-offs, and solutions. This project will also prepare for technical interviews by 
providing clear examples and solutions to commonly encountered problems in system design.

## Topics and subtopics

The project covers the following system design topics:

### Basics
    - What is System Design
    - Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling
    - What is Capacity Estimation

    - What is Load Balancing?
    - What is Consistent Hashing?
    - What is Sharding?

### Data Stores
    - What are Bloom Filters?
    - What is Data Replication?
    - How are NoSQL databases optimized?
    - What are Location-based Databases?
    - Database Migration

### Consistency vs. Availability
    - What is Data Consistency?
    - Data Consistency Levels
    - Transaction Isolation Levels

### Message Queues

    - What is a Message Queue?
    - What is the publisher-subscriber model?
    - What are event-driven systems?
    - Database as a Message Queue

### DevOps Concepts
    - What is a Single Point of Failure?
    - What are Containers?
    - What is Service Discovery and Heartbeats?
    - How to avoid Cascading Failures?
    - Anomaly Detection in Distributed Systems
    - Distributed Rate Limiting

### Caching
    - What is Distributed Caching?
    - What are Content Delivery Networks?
    - Write Policies
    - Replacement Policies

### Microservices
    - Microservices vs. Monoliths
    - How monoliths are migrated

### API Gateways
    - How are APIs designed?
    - What are asynchronous APIs?

### Authentication Mechanisms
    - OAuth
    - Token-Based Authentication
    - Access Control Lists and Rule Engines

### System Design Tradeoffs
    - Pull vs. Push
    - Memory vs. Latency
    - Throughput vs. Latency

## SetUp Instruction
### Requirements
* Optional: Diagramming tools like **Lucidchart**, **Draw.io**, or **Excalidraw** for documenting architecture  
* Text editor eg [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)


### Getting Started


1. Clone the repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JosephMugo8711/systemdesign-architecture
    ```

    ```bash
    cd systemdesign-architecture
    ```

2. Install dependencies
After cloning the repository, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```


## Technologies Used

    -  Node.js
    -  TypeScript
    -  Express.js
    -  Redis (for caching)
    -  RabbitMQ (for message queues)
    -  Docker (for containerization)
